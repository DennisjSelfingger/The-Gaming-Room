Software Design Document for "Draw It or Lose It"
Project Overview

This project was developed for The Gaming Room, a company seeking to expand their popular mobile game, "Draw It or Lose It", into a web-based platform. The goal was to design software that could engage players across various devices, ensuring a seamless and inclusive gaming experience. The requirements emphasized the need for a system that supports multiple teams and players, enforces unique identifiers, and operates efficiently across diverse network conditions.
Reflections on the Development Process
Strengths in Documentation

I believe one of my strongest contributions to this project was the detailed and clear documentation I developed. My approach to outlining the system architecture, domain model, and design constraints provided a solid foundation for both the client and development team. This clarity helped in aligning the project's goals with the technical strategies we decided to implement.
Value of Design Documentation

The process of working through the design document proved invaluable, especially when it came to translating these plans into code. The structured breakdown of requirements and system architecture allowed me to anticipate potential challenges and consider various solutions ahead of the actual development phase. This preparation made the coding process more straightforward and efficient.
Areas for Improvement

If I were to revise any part of my work, I would delve deeper into the evaluation of different technologies and platforms during the initial design phase. Specifically, a more thorough analysis of the pros and cons of server-side options could have provided even clearer guidance for choosing the most suitable infrastructure for "Draw It or Lose It."
Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

Understanding and integrating user needs into the software design was a critical aspect of this project. Through user stories and feedback sessions, we identified key features and usability priorities for the target audience. Ensuring the software was accessible, engaging, and easy to use across different devices was paramount. This user-centric approach not only informed the design choices but also underscored the importance of empathy in software development.
Design Approach and Future Strategies

My approach to designing this software was iterative and collaborative, focusing on modularity and scalability. Techniques like using design patterns (Singleton and Iterator) and emphasizing a tiered architecture model facilitated a robust yet flexible application structure. In future projects, I plan to further leverage user feedback loops and prototype testing to refine the design process. Additionally, exploring more about containerization and microservices could offer even greater scalability and efficiency for similar applications.
Conclusion

This project for The Gaming Room represents a significant milestone in my journey as a software developer. It challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, client-driven context and underscored the importance of detailed planning, user-centered design, and adaptability. I look forward to building on these experiences in my future endeavors in the field of computer science.
